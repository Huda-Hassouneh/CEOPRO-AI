CEOPRO AI - Catalog-Based Entity Matching (spec S15: PRODUCT, SUPPLIER,
COMPETITOR entity types). These aren't pattern-shaped like MONEY/DATE/EMAIL -
they're look-ups against a tenant's own known names, so they're matched
against a catalog rather than a regex. Reuses the same name-similarity
approach already used for competitor price matching (spec S22: shared,
consistent approach rather than reinventing per module) rather than
duplicating a second fuzzy-matching implementation.
